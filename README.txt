//Those with vision and drive, will thrive. 

I made this portfolio to both show my work, as well as create a workspace to add my projects too. 
The login originally was going to be made in Angular, however I chose to make it with Python & Django instead. 

This is an ongoing process and my first portfolio to date. The first copy will be published by 6/08/2020 and will be updated as I go.

I am looking for my first job as a web developer as I am currently 35% through my MIS going part time. 

I love web development and will share my resources with the world.

Hello Matthew,

I have just gone online to check all my students online participation in their course shells and current grades.  Your participation and current grade are exceptional and I just wanted to take this opportunity to recognize the effort you are making. 

Many times when someone is doing what they are suppose to be doing they may think their efforts are not being noticed or appreciated.  I want to let you know I am aware of the exceptional effort you have been making and want to recognize and thank you for it.

Matt - I didn't even share the pulse survey where someon said there were too many assignments and too much work in the class. Now part of me agrees that there doesn't need to do an assignment every week and this Week 2 assignment where you interviewed 2 people within the week is a bit much in terms of time to setup and get the two interviews done. But I've come to realize someone people are just not MBA material. What people don't realize is completing this class well maybe get your a letter of recommendation, a job interview or even a job offer. My one business, we have hired 3 Keller graduates that were in my classes! Some people just don't see the big picture Matt!

And I get it that this Group Project can be a pain in the behind. But I'm not going to let anyone get a good grade without participaiting in the work. How is your Group Matt?

You're doing a great job. 100 pts your your Week 2 assignment. Please be sure to go into the week 3 pulse survey and give 4 stars and make a comment as well.
