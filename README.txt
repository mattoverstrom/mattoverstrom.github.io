//Those with vision and drive, will thrive. 

I made this portfolio to both show my work, as well as create a workspace to add my projects too. 
The login originally was going to be made in Angular, however I chose to make it with Python & Django instead. 

This is an ongoing process and my first portfolio to date. The first copy will be published by 6/08/2020 and will be updated as I go.

I am looking for my first job as a web developer as I am currently 35% through my MIS going part time. 

I love web development and will share my resources with the world.

Hello Matthew,

I have just gone online to check all my students online participation in their course shells and current grades.  Your participation and current grade are exceptional and I just wanted to take this opportunity to recognize the effort you are making. 

Many times when someone is doing what they are suppose to be doing they may think their efforts are not being noticed or appreciated.  I want to let you know I am aware of the exceptional effort you have been making and want to recognize and thank you for it.
