//porfolio showcasing Matt Overstrom's work

youtube api, python- aws, drawing app, about me


I made this portfolio to both show my work, as well as create a workspace to add my projects too. 
The login originally was going to be made in Angular, however I chose to make it with Python & Django instead. 

This is an ongoing process and my first portfolio to date. The first copy will be published by 6/08/2020 and will be updated as I go.

I am looking for my first job as a web developer as I am currently 35% through my MIS going part time. 

I love web development and will share my resources with the world.
